# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The motivation for creating this project was with an intention to have an effective study guide to use for studying code and all the different elements. Also, it was a great project to learn new skills and hone them in HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript. The problem that it solved was getting prepared for the first day of the coding bootcamp in order to be fully set. Throughout this project, I was able to learn how to think and act as a developer, learn about HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript and get the fundamentals down for what's to come in the six months of classwork.
